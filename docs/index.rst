Project 2: The Day after Tomorrow
======================================================

Synopsis
========

"The Day After Tomorrow" challenge is a mock exercise designed to enhance
emergency protocols under hurricane threats. It simulates a scenario where
FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) in the US has opened a competition
for teams of ML specialists to forecast the evolution of tropical cyclones 
in real-time. The challenge involves developing solutions to accurately predict 
hurricane trajectories and impacts using advanced machine learning techniques.


Problem Definition
==================

The problem posed in this challenge is significant and urgent, considering 
the devastating impact of hurricanes. Hurricanes can cause massive damages, 
including loss of lives and property. The project aims to leverage machine 
learning in developing predictive models that can accurately forecast the 
trajectory and intensity of tropical cyclones. This initiative seeks to 
improve emergency response and preparedness, ultimately saving lives and 
reducing economic losses.

The project specifically addresses two topics through leveraging deep learning namely,
storm sequence image predicition to gain visual representations of storm evolution
based upon prior images of storms at relative times and generation of wind speed predictions 
based upon these generated images.

Usage of AI Tools
=================

ChatGPT generated docstrings for most functions, however, these were ratified with common sense
in coding review.

We utilized ChatGPT for some parts of XXX but again this was used primarily for _playing_ with ideas
and getting baseline implementations to build upon, ultimately we didn't directly use the answers,
we modified a lot as this was almost always necessary.

We learned a sphinx theme online and used it for documentation.
